# Mesh Segmentation
Yet another re-implementation of the paper "Hierarchical Mesh Decomposition using Fuzzy Clustering and Cuts". 

Note: This implementation only includes the binary case mentioned in the paper without finetuning some of the parameters because the author is very noob and lazy.

Credit to [fornorp](https://github.com/fornorp/Mesh-Segmentation), [geeksforgeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for their extremely useful open-source code.
